# Starting notes
I began this thread on preliminary analysis on October 30th, 2024. I am going to be looking at the first 20 northern elephant seals I've resequenced (10 mother-offspring pairs, whole genome sequencing). This preliminary look will help me determine lots of things, including how many more individuals I should aim to sequence and how much coverage I'll need per individual. 

I will be putting code here that will help me streamline the QC of my samples and prepare them for analyses. This will be a slow process, and hopefully I will be learning a lot. I'm going to try a lot of this on my own, but will reach out for help when needed. I hope I can create a robust bioinformatic pipeline that will serve me in the future. LET'S GOOOOO

Putting this as a to-do list for myself, but: 
1.) I need to detail the methods for how I created the genome libraries for this initial batch of resequencing and how they were sequenced. 

Here is a neat little figure from the CD Genomics website (https://bioinfo.cd-genomics.com/whole-genome-resequencing-analysis.html):

This should thus be the data analysis workflow I am aiming to replicate. :)
