# Starting notes
I began this thread on preliminary analysis on October 30th, 2024. I am going to be looking at the first 20 northern elephant seals I've resequenced (10 mother-offspring pairs, whole genome sequencing). This preliminary look will help me determine lots of things, including how many more individuals I should aim to sequence and how much coverage I'll need per individual. 

I will be putting code here that will help me streamline the QC of my samples and prepare them for analyses. This will be a slow process, and hopefully I will be learning a lot. I'm going to try a lot of this on my own, but will reach out for help when needed. LET'S GOOOOO
